description: "a few things i wrote down while listening to Naval on leverage"
---

# inputs which are less egaliatarian 

labour / people & capital

# more egalitarian ?

code / media - build products on these for ethical wealth creation

----

rolex for signalling value - zero sum game

- **be here! (in the middle)**

netlfix / youtube for everyone - positive sum game

# tech has amortized cost of production

capital & human labour has reduced in food production - more tech oriented now

**example:** jeff bezos is not eating better food? just different food with human touch - theatrically presented

# create wealth ethically using technology / code / media as leverage

equally available for everybody - better scale economy - used more by people - large budget - user additon has no cost - higher quality? - use budget to create more quality

------

> wealthy people use money on signalling goods to show wealth and play the status game, not actually consuming the goods for benefit

- people & capital -ve externality
- code & product +ve externality

**permissioned / permissionless**

- community - diffused form of labour - ex: facebook
- capital & labour becoming permissionless

> rich people price up things so only they can have them, hence the value remains... can you bring the value down so everyone can have it? what would happen then? how can you do THIS?
