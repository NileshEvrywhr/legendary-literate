# The Biggest Myth in Education
-----------------------------

refer veritasium's education myth vid - write your own summary on medium on your own blog - or send it to me - i can include it here on the website - watch book summary vids

but in moderation - kyunki 4 vids ke baad you don't know where you'll end up

point being learn from all kinds of format - you're not a single kind of learner

not just that - write summaries for learning through writing - explain to others for learning through speaking - if that's your thing

# How I Read Books ?
--------------------

## **morning** - the free blink of the day (whilst preparing breakfast)
## **afternoon or night** - physical books (i always have 2 open books at all times, recent experimentation)
## **audible** - while cooking OR cleaning (doing tasks around the house)
