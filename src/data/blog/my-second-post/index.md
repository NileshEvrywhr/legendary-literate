Did you ever get the error on Blinkist where it said there is somethign wrong with your internet connection? I didn't know that many people who used Blinkist so I can't confirm but I used to get that a lot. Once 3 days in a row. By the time an early version of this website was ready. 

**Hosted On Netlify**
-----------------
Having two address fields violates the principle of Familiarity that states the system should match the user’s real world expectations. When there’s a match, users can interpret the interface based on conventions they’re already familiar with.


**Cronjob Gets The Latest Books**
-----------------------------
The second address field forces the user to type their address in the system’s preferred format, not the user’s. In the real world, users think of addresses as a single entity. Two text fields causes them to perceive their address as separate entities. Users don’t expect to see this which is why they get confused.


**Metalsmith to Generate Ebook Formats**
-----------------------------
not just that, from what i understand... metalsmith is a file transformer, you give it some input like markdown or HTML, and pass it through plugins to get different outputs, also order of plugins matter, static websites can also be created, that's how I found out about it when I was researching about static site generators for my [personal webiste](https://nilesheverywhere.com), but i'm no developer.

also planning to release a tool in the form of a node binary that converts markdown into ebook formats

**Domain is Free at Freenom**
-------------------------------
thedailyb.link is available at ₹(600-700) at porkbun & namecheap.


audio version bhi aa jayega, depending on response kaisa h, and feedback do - social media - kahi bhi - i'm available everywhere literally
