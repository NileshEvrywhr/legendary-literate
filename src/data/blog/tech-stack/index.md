Did you ever get the error on Blinkist where it said there is something wrong with your internet connection? I didn't know any people who used Blinkist personally so I can't confirm but I've been getting the error for a week now. And that is why this app exists. 

**Hosted On Netlify**
-----------------


**Cronjob Gets The Latest Books**
-----------------------------


**Metalsmith to Generate Ebook Formats**
-----------------------------
not just that, metalsmith is a file transformer, you give it some input like markdown or HTML, and pass it through plugins to get different outputs, also order of plugins matter, static websites can also be created, that's how I found out about it when I was researching about static site generators for my [personal webiste](https://nilesheverywhere.com), as i'm no developer.


**Domain is Free at Freenom**
-------------------------------
thedailyb.link is available at ₹(600-700) at porkbun & namecheap. but i'm currently using a free domain.


if the response on this app is good enough, or i have enough time, i'll put more effort on fixing what's needed - follow me anywhere - please give feedback - DM, e-mail or social media - anywhere :P
